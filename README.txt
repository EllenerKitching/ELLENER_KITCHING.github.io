I was able to get a footer onto the page however I could only get it to sit at the bottom of the content instead of the bottom of the actual page.Who have I discussed/collaborated the assignment with:Thomas Roseo	Helped me fix the margin issue with the headers at the beginning of the process.o	Advised me to have only once central CSS ‘style sheet’ instead of one for each page.o	Advised me to have a navigation bar instead of individual links sitting in the page. Development of the siteI began this project with creating all of the html pages, as well as the main CSS stylesheet and an images folder.Before I started the project, I made a set of wire frames to give myself a visual insight as to how I want the pages to look, and therefore I was able to write the code accordingly.I wanted to have a clear colour scheme running throughout my site and so I found a set of matching colours online1 and used the hex codes provided in my stylesheet to set a background colour and font colour for example.I have used a Google web font within my pages to style the <h1> tag, the navigation list items also all of the subheadings within the page content. The link to this web font is given at the top of each HTML page to ensure that this font is used throughout the site.To create the navigation bar I used an un-ordered list. Each list item contained a ‘href’ to another page within the site to allow the user to easily navigate their way between the pages. Within the CSS I was then able to style the list in a way, which made it appear as a navigation bar across the top of the page.One obstacle included getting ‘a:active’ in the navigation styling within the CSS to work. After many searches for a solution as to why this feature wouldn’t appear on my site, I decided not to include it in the final design.After checking for errors in the general layout, I copied the code developed in the index into every other html page to ensure they all had the exact same layout.Moving onto the CV page, I started by making all of my subheadings. I used the <h3> tag for these headers as will have for all of the subheadings within the site. In the stylesheet I then specified the font family and colour.After in-putting all of the content, I ensured the headings where close to the text, by editing the line height in the paragraph class in the CSS2.I then moved onto the biography page. Once all the content had been inputted, I decided the page looked slightly bare. I thought I would add some special elements into it to make it more enjoyable for the user, therefore I added in a bold quote standing out on the right hand side of the page. For this I used the <blockquote> tag3. In my CSS page I then floated this to the right. To accompany the quote I decided to add in an image of a painting I had recently done, to tell the user abit more about myself.Finally the contact page. I began structuring this page with the basic elements it would need4, including text inputs and text areas. I wanted to have two sides to the page5, and so I used two <div> tags and classed them, then in the CSS I specified them to float left with a width of 50% so that they would sit uniform next to each other.To get icons on the right hand side of the page for my contact details, I used Font Awesome6. Between the head tags I added the link to the site, and then nested in the <div> tags, I added <i> tags (widely used for icons).After adding all of the essential elements I began styling the page. A simple addition to the page was adding a hover colour in the CSS to the submit button.To minimise the amount of space used on the page, I decided to make the name of the information to be submitted in each box sit actually inside the box. This was done using the <placeholder> tags7.References1 The Martin Agency (20 Dec. 2013).  An Idea Lives On [online].
