<!-- Main Content -->
<p>
I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Northampton,
studying computing. As a student I do not yet have a wide range of professional
experience or skills, however I am always willing to learn.
</p>
<p>
Alongside my studies, I volunteer in my local community. I help our local rugby
club with a range of activities from serving meals to organising fundraising.
This has shown that I am able to take instruction and be helpful.
</p>
<p>
Due to my love of children, I am also a Brownie Leader. I am currently taking my
leadership qualification, which involves a great deal of organisation. I feel I
am developing key moral skills of the girls. I believe that this leadership role
is very relevant to teaching. It requires similar qualities as listed in the
teaching standards, such as setting high expectations to inspire, motivate and
challenge the children.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I like to draw and paint (anything involving crafts really!). I
enjoy using my interesting ideas in all my tasks set and because of this I find
it easy to apply myself creatively as it is a natural talent.
</p>
<p>
My reliability, communication skills, responsibility and friendly nature are
assets I always bring to any environment.
</p>
<p>
I have the ability to work independently using my own initiative and as a
team. I can be shy in new surroundings, but when accustom to them, I
definitely come out of my shell to work hardest. I also have the ability to
prioritise whilst under pressure meeting tight deadlines.
